# Machine Learning Implementations from Scratch

Idea is to implement various layers from scratch using only Python + some other minor libraries such as NumPy or SciPy for speedup of core algorithms like dot product, cross-correlation, etc. for educational purposes.

### Currently Implemented

- Base Layer
- Dense Layer / Fully Connected Layer
- Convolution Layer
